# Books Pagination 

This project is a small web app that pulls in data for Greek Books. It shows the book title, book publication city, author. You can use the previous or next page buttons to cycle through the list of books shown on every page.  

## Getting Started

## Running the tests

Run npm test --coverage 

## Improvements
-   Making the api call a reusable function
-   Add the searchbar to find specific data points
-   Did not receive all the data points using parameters, response only shows 20 data objects
